Documentation
-------------

Documentation is located in the `docs` directory.  
It is built using [sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/), and is best viewed in a browser.

> $ pip install -r requirements.txt  
> $ cd docs  
> $ make html  
> $ firefox _build/html/index.html &

All documentation is written in [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html).
