Documentation
-------------

Documentation is located in the `docs` directory.  
It is written in [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html), it is built using [sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/), and it is best viewed in an internet browser like Chrome or Firefox.

> $ git clone git@github.com:rosshamish/classtime  
> $ cd classtime  
> $ pip install -r requirements.txt  
> $ cd docs  
> $ make html  
> $ firefox _build/html/index.html &

If you find something unclear, broken, or missing: [add an issue](https://github.com/RossHamish/classtime/issues/new) to the [docs work queue](https://github.com/RossHamish/classtime/milestones). Be critical - it'll only improve faster. Note: if other tasks take priority, a small percentage of these might be ignored.
