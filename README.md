Documentation
-------------

Documentation is located in the `docs` directory.  
It is written in [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html), it is built using [sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/), and it is best viewed in an internet browser like Chrome or Firefox.

If something is unclear, or you find a typo, [add an issue](https://github.com/RossHamish/classtime/issues/new) to the [docs work queue](https://github.com/RossHamish/classtime/milestones). Be critical - it'll only improve faster. Note: if other tasks take priority, a small percentage of these might be ignored.
