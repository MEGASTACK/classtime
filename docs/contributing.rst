Commit messages loosely follow the `Angular.js commit message style guide <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit?pli=1#>`__.  The purpose is to sprinkle about 10 characters of background information into the front of each commit message.

For the most part, commit messages are written in the present tense - the message tells others **what the commit will do** if they merge the changes into their branch.

Template ::

	type(context): change X to Y from Z

Good ::

	a4kd93 feat(schedule-generation): add electives support to the API  
	bd8663 docs(api): document new electives support  
	9d9f77 tests(schedule-generation): add tests to verify sane scheduling of electives

Not good ::

	a4kd93 api has electives now  
	bd8663 documented electives feature  
	9d9f77 hopefully electives work, tests are in now

Github issues are used for discussion, questions, and task tracking. Don't worry about assigning labels.
